THIS IS JUST A FUN LITTLE PROJECT FOR FRIENDS

## To-do list
*anything that is "removed" may be a togglable option or something that is unloaded instead of removed entirely*

- Replacing laggy "erect" maps with original versions
- Allow certain debug keys without debug mode, and unlock all songs and characters automatically (so basically just weekend stuff)
- Remove special effects/shaders that lag game
- Removing rain from weekend songs
- Anti Aliasing option (or just turned off automatically)
- Notes unaffected by Anti Aliasing
- Add mods seperated by folders (in the freeplay menu)
- Really bad computer option: All assets except notes and chart is unloaded
- Add source code to the github
